This is actually **one of the most practical pain points in NLP**:
**High-quality labeled data is extremely valuable—and extremely time-consuming to produce.**

---

## 1. Do professionals also label data slowly, one by one?

**The answer is: most of the time—yes!**

* Big companies (Google, OpenAI, ByteDance, Alibaba, Microsoft, etc.) often have **dedicated labeling teams** (or outsource to data labeling vendors) who manually annotate data one by one.
* Even benchmark datasets used in academic papers (like GLUE, SQuAD) are mostly manually labeled over months or even years.

For example:

* **SQuAD (QA dataset):** Many people manually wrote questions and labeled answers one by one.
* **GLUE, SuperGLUE:** Many classification tasks rely on manually labeled data.

Especially for tasks like **sentence-pair relevance classification**, human understanding of semantics is crucial → it’s not suitable to rely entirely on machine-generated data.

## 2. Then how do some people manage to get tens of thousands of data points?

This is where several “acceleration techniques” come into play:

---

### (A) **Automatically generated weak labels (weak supervision)**

* Use keyword rules, search engines, or existing models to generate preliminary labels.
* Examples:

  * Find news headlines containing “Apple releases” → automatically label as relevant.
  * Use an existing model to score sentence pairs → high scores treated as “relevant,” low scores as “irrelevant.”

**Drawbacks:**

* Often imprecise.
* Usually still requires human review.

Many companies follow a pattern:

> Auto-generate → Manually sample and verify → Retrain → Iterate continuously.

---

### (B) **Web scraping + naturally existing labels**

In some domains, data comes with “natural” labels:

* E-commerce: product → customer reviews (relevant)
* News sites: article → popular comments
* Social media: retweets / quote tweets

However, challenges include:

* Scraped data can be **very inconsistent in quality**.
* The concept of “relevance” can be very hard to auto-label. For example:

  * “Apple releases chip” + “The weather is hot”

    → Not relevant.

  * “Apple releases chip” + “The new laptop battery is bigger”

    → Is it relevant? This might require true semantic understanding.

---

### (C) **Semi-automatic labeling (Active Learning)**

* Start with a small set of manually labeled data to train a model.
* Then use the model to identify the most uncertain samples and prioritize those for human labeling.
* This significantly reduces the amount of manual labeling needed.

This is extremely popular in industry. For example:

> Label 200 examples → Train a model → Select 500 samples where the model is most uncertain → Manually label those → Repeat the cycle.

---

## 3. Can large models like ChatGPT help generate labeled data?

Yes, but **use caution**:

* ChatGPT can help generate sample data pairs along with labels.
* Drawbacks:

  * Generated data may not match the true distribution of real-world data.
  * The model may inadvertently reinforce its own biases or errors (data leakage).

In industry, such synthetic data is typically used only for **pre-training** or **data augmentation**, rather than as the sole data source.

## 4. My Recommendation

If you’re working on sentence-pair relevance classification:

**Step 1**
Start by manually labeling a small set of data (e.g. 200–500 examples) to ensure the model learns genuine patterns.

**Step 2**
Train a model and analyze where it’s most uncertain → manually label those uncertain examples.

**Step 3**
Then consider:

* Scraping data (e.g. news + comments)
* Using ChatGPT to help generate sample pairs (and manually verify them)
* Applying weak supervision techniques

This will give you the best efficiency.

## In Summary:

> Yes—professionals usually label data manually, but smart combinations of machine pre-filtering, weak supervision, and pre-trained models can dramatically reduce human effort. Avoid relying purely on automatically generated data; the quality often isn’t good enough.
